  "description": "Prove that equality is symmetric: if `x = y` then `y = x`.\n\n**Goal:** `forall (A : Type) (x y : A), x = y -> y = x`\n\nThis is one of the fundamental properties of equality. In Coq, you can prove it using `rewrite` to substitute equals for equals.",
  "hints": [
    "Use `intros` to introduce all variables and the equality hypothesis `H`",
    "Use `rewrite H` to replace `x` with `y` (or `rewrite <- H` to go the other way) in the goal",
    "After rewriting, the goal becomes `y = y` or `x = x`, which follows by `reflexivity`"
