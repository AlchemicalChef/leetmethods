  "description": "Prove the contrapositive law: if `P` implies `Q`, then `~Q` implies `~P`.\n\n**Goal:** `forall P Q : Prop, (P -> Q) -> ~Q -> ~P`\n\nThe contrapositive is one of the most important logical principles. Remember that `~P` unfolds to `P -> False`, so after introducing all hypotheses you need to derive `False`.",
  "hints": [
    "Use `intros` to introduce `P`, `Q`, `HPQ : P -> Q`, `HnQ : ~Q`, and `HP : P`",
    "Apply `HnQ` — this reduces the goal from `False` to `Q`",
    "Then apply `HPQ` to reduce `Q` to `P`, which you already have"
