  "description": "Prove that from `P` we can derive `~~P` (double negation introduction).\n\n**Goal:** `forall P : Prop, P -> ~~P`\n\nRemember that `~P` is defined as `P -> False`, so `~~P` is `(P -> False) -> False`.\n\nThis direction of double negation is provable in intuitionistic logic.",
  "hints": [
    "Unfold the definition of negation: ~P means P -> False",
    "After intros, you'll have P and need to prove False from (P -> False)",
    "If you have H : P -> False and HP : P, then (H HP) gives you False"
