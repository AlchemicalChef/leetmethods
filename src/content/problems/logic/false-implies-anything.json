  "description": "Prove that `False` implies any proposition. This is the principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet).\n\n**Goal:** `forall P : Prop, False -> P`\n\nIn Coq, `False` is an inductive type with no constructors. If you have a hypothesis of type `False`, you can use `destruct` on it to close any goal, since there are no cases to consider.",

    "Use `intros` to introduce P and the False hypothesis",
