  "description": "Prove the classic modus ponens rule: if we have `P` and `P -> Q`, then we can conclude `Q`.\n\n**Goal:** `forall P Q : Prop, P -> (P -> Q) -> Q`\n\nThis is one of the most fundamental rules of propositional logic. In Coq, implications are proved by introducing hypotheses and then applying them.",

    "Use `intros` to introduce the propositions and hypotheses into your context",
    "Once you have both P and (P -> Q) as hypotheses, you can use `apply` to use the implication"
