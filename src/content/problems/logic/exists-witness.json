  "description": "Prove that there exists a natural number that doubled equals 4.\n\n**Goal:** `exists n : nat, n + n = 4`\n\nTo prove an existential statement in Coq, use the `exists` tactic to provide a concrete witness value. Then prove that the witness satisfies the property.",
  "hints": [
    "Think about which number, when added to itself, gives 4",
    "Use `exists 2` to provide the witness",
    "After providing the witness, the goal becomes `2 + 2 = 4` which can be solved by computation"
