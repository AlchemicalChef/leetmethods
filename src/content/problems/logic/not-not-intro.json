  "description": "Prove that any proposition implies its double negation: if `P` holds, then `P` cannot be refuted.\n\n**Goal:** `forall P : Prop, P -> ~~P`\n\nRecall that `~P` is defined as `P -> False` in Coq, so `~~P` is `(P -> False) -> False`. You need to show that assuming both `P` and `~P` leads to a contradiction.",
  "hints": [
    "Use `intros` to introduce `P`, a proof `HP` of `P`, and a proof `HnP` of `~P` (i.e., `P -> False`)",
    "You now have a contradiction: `HnP` says `P` is false, but `HP` says `P` is true. Use `apply HnP` to reduce the goal to `P`"
