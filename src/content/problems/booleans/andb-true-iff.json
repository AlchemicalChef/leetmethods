  "description": "Prove the logical characterization of `andb`: the conjunction `andb a b` is `true` if and only if both `a` and `b` are `true`.\n\n**Goal:** `forall a b : bool, andb a b = true <-> a = true /\\ b = true`\n\nThis proof requires handling both directions of the `<->` (iff) connective using `split`, and case analysis on the boolean values.",
  "hints": [
    "Use `split` to separate the proof into two directions (forward and backward)",
    "For the forward direction, use `destruct a; destruct b` and `discriminate` to rule out impossible cases",
