  "description": "Prove that boolean AND (`andb`) is commutative: the order of arguments does not matter.\n\n**Goal:** `forall a b : bool, andb a b = andb b a`\n\nSince `bool` is a finite type with two values, you can prove this by exhaustive case analysis on both arguments.",

    "Use `destruct a` to case-split on the first boolean",
