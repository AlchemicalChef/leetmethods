  "description": "Prove that negating a boolean value twice gives back the original value.\n\n**Goal:** `forall b : bool, negb (negb b) = b`\n\nThis is a classic first proof about booleans. Since `bool` has only two constructors (`true` and `false`), you can prove this by checking both cases.",

    "Use `destruct b` to split into the `true` and `false` cases",
    "After case splitting, `simpl` or `reflexivity` should close each goal"
