  "description": "Prove the logical characterization of `orb`: the disjunction `orb a b` is `true` if and only if at least one of `a` or `b` is `true`.\n\n**Goal:** `forall a b : bool, orb a b = true <-> a = true \\/ b = true`\n\nThis requires handling both directions of `<->`, case analysis, and working with the `\\/` (or) connective in Coq.",
  "hints": [
    "Use `split` to handle each direction of the iff separately",
    "Forward: use `destruct a; destruct b` — for each `true` case, choose `left` or `right`; for `false, false`, use `discriminate`",
    "Backward: use `intros [Ha | Hb]` to case-split on the disjunction, then `rewrite` the hypothesis"
