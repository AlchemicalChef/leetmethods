  "description": "Prove that adding 1 to the right of a natural number is the same as taking its successor.\n\n**Goal:** `forall n : nat, n + 1 = S n`\n\nSince addition is defined by recursion on the left argument, `n + 1` does not simplify directly when `n` is a variable. You need induction.",
  "hints": [
    "Perform `induction` on `n`",
    "The base case `0 + 1 = S 0` simplifies directly",
    "In the inductive case, `simpl` reduces `S n' + 1` to `S (n' + 1)`, then apply the induction hypothesis"
