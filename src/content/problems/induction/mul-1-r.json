  "description": "Prove that multiplying any natural number by 1 gives back the same number.\n\n**Goal:** `forall n : nat, n * 1 = n`\n\nThis is not as trivial as it looks! Coq's `*` is defined by recursion on the left argument, so `n * 1` doesn't simplify directly. You need induction.",
  "hints": [
    "Perform `induction` on `n`",
    "The base case `0 * 1 = 0` simplifies directly",
    "In the inductive case, `simpl` reduces `S n' * 1` to `S (n' * 1)`, then apply the induction hypothesis"
