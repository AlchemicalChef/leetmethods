  "description": "Prove that successor distributes from outside to inside on the right argument of addition.\n\n**Goal:** `forall n m : nat, S (n + m) = n + S m`\n\nThis is a fundamental lemma about natural number addition that is used in many other proofs (e.g., commutativity of addition).",
  "hints": [
    "Perform `induction` on `n`",
    "The base case simplifies directly with `simpl`",
    "In the inductive case, `simpl` reduces `S (S n' + m)` to `S (S (n' + m))`, then use `rewrite` with the induction hypothesis"
